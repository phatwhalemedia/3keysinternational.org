            often come in saying: “so, how’s this different then?” And they leave saying they get it! This work has made
            the difference in their that lives no other inner work has made, but… how can we explain why?</p>
            <p class="mediumSizeFont justifytext textboxpadding nomargintop">For one thing, 3Keys practitioners do not give advice, nor do we see our clients as in need of  Instead, we see ourselves as working in partnership with a client, offering the tools they need to alleviate dis-ease and create amazing lives. We do this by integrating both left brain, cognitive approaches and affective, or right brain, work – a unique combination.</p>

                life you want. Trust us – if it’s there, we’ll find it and empower you to deal with it as and when
                you’re ready.</p>
                
                <p class="mediumSizeFont justifytext textboxpadding nomargintop">From the start of our work together, we provide you with the tools you need to consistently make good, rational decisions for yourself and operate from your strongest, most powerful self. Throughout the process, we encourage you to use these tools in between our sessions and report back, gently encouraging you to use them more and more independently. We make you the director of your own life.</p>

We cannot predict how long the process will take for each individual, but if you are willing to do the work, we will be with you to the end, as long as you need us. Oh and, yes, there is an end – we never work with someone indefinitely and rarely longer than a year. After that, you can fly solo.</p>
