                <p class="mediumSizeFont justifytext textboxpadding nomargintop">3Keys work combines an affective, or right brain, approach, cognitive analysis techniques and action-setting. We believe that this combination is highly effective because it not only helps our clients become aware of and discuss the patterns they wish to be free of but also, crucially, drills right down to the core beliefs informing these patterns, and enables clients to reprogram them.</p>
                <p class="mediumSizeFont justifytext textboxpadding nomargintop">At least 90% of who we are and what we do is controlled by the subconscious. 3Keys work focuses on this realm. The affective, or right-brain approach, explores beliefs, ideas and emotional response patterns located within the subconscious, which override conscious control and rational thinking. Affective work does not advise or fix. Instead, we facilitate our client’s exploration of the subconscious, empowering them to make any changes they themselves consider necessary.</p>

            <div class="answerContainer">
                <p class="mediumSizeFont justifytext textboxpadding no nomargintop">The 3Keys method uses the Myers Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI®), which gives us an excellent description of a client’s True Self and also allows us to clearly see whether the client is making good, rational decisions congruent with their True Self type.

<!--                    Using these typing tools helps clients differentiate between these two parts of their personality, and empower them to begin trusting their own innate inner strengths, learning to operate out of those.</p>-->
                <p class="mediumSizeFont justifytext textboxpadding">We believe that, often when someone is under stress or in emotional pain, they are not really themselves; instead, they are operating out of a subconscious, irrational defense system. In the 3Keys model, we profile this defense part of personality using the Enneagram typing tool. Our first task, then, is to get around the defense system part of personality and learn who our client really is.</p>

            <div class="answerContainer">
                <p class="mediumSizeFont justifytext textboxpadding nomargintop">By exploring all the subconscious issues that cause the irrational Enneagram defense to be in place, we help to disengage the early programming and the need for the defense system. This then allows the client to operate out of the MBTI<sup>&reg</sup> – or True Self – part of personality, with full access to all their commensurate gifts, talents and wisdom.</p>
                <p class="mediumSizeFont justifytext textboxpadding">In order to achieve this, we employ a variety of right-brain tools and techniques (such as imagery, music, art and non-dominant hand writing) to access information that is out of consciousness.</p>
                <p class="mediumSizeFont justifytext textboxpadding">This process is immensely empowering as it allows clients to take the lead in discovering how to consistently make good, rational decisions for themselves, and to continue operating from their strongest, most powerful self.</p>
                <p class="mediumSizeFont justifytext textboxpadding">The unique nature of our process also means that we empower our clients to use the tools of the process themselves once the formal work with their Practitioner is over. This makes our model a sustainable one that clients can use on an ongoing basis to do what is right for themselves, to keep grounded and to live authentically without needing to depend on their Practitioner once the formal aspect is completed.</p>

                <p class="mediumSizeFont justifytext textboxpadding">The 3Keys process is life-changing.
